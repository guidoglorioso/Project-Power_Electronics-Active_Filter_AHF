# Project Title

## Overview

Code repository for the project "Active Filter for Harmonic Distortion" of the subject "Power Electronics" at the Technological University of Buenos Aires. This project focuses on designing and implementing an Active Harmonic Filter (AHF) to mitigate harmonic distortion in electrical power systems, thereby improving power quality and efficiency.
